 ## Apex - Next.js Authentication with AI API Integration

Apex is a Next.js project that showcases how to implement authentication and integrate an AI API into your application. This project aims to provide a starting point for developers who want to build secure authentication systems in Next.js applications while leveraging the power of AI APIs.
## Features
User registration and login functionality with email and password- JWT-based authentication system for secure user sessions- Integration of an AI API for advanced AI-powered features- Protected routes that require authentication- UI components for user authentication flows- Customizable and extensible codebase
## Technologies Used
- Next.js: A popular React framework for building server-side rendered and static websites
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for easy and responsive styling
- Express.js: A flexible Node.js web application framework for building APIs and server-side logic- MongoDB: A popular NoSQL database for storing user data
- JWT: JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication and session management- AI API (e.g., OpenAI GPT-3): An AI-powered API for integrating advanced features into your application
## Getting Started
Prerequisites- Node.js (v14 or higher)- MongoDB database
### Installation
1.Clone the repository:   git clone https://github.com/alirazaztdev1/apex-frontend.git  ```
2. Install dependencies:   cd apex-frontend npm install 
3. Set up environment variables:   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:   ````   MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret   AI_API_KEY=your-ai-api-key    Replace your-mongodb-uri with your MongoDB connection URI, your-jwt-secret with a secure secret for JWT token generation, and your-ai-api-key with the API key for your chosen AI API.
4. Run the development server: ```` npm run dev ``` The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
## Usage
Register a new user account using the provided registration form.- Log in with your credentials to access the protected routes.- Explore the integrated AI features and experience the power of AI in action.
